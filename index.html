        <p>Bedford Off Broadway (a NH non-profit Community Theater Company) is happy to announce auditions for their 2026 winter show "Lost in Yonkers" written by Neil Simon have been completed. The play will be directed by Catherine Andruskevich and stage managed by Pat Napolitano.</p>

			 <p>"Lost in Yonkers" delves into themes of family, love, loss, and resilience. The characters are richly developed, showcasing the complexities of familial relationships. Grandma Kurnitz embodies tough love, having built a protective shell around herself due to her past traumas. The play highlights the struggles of each character, particularly the boys, as they learn valuable life lessons about responsibility and the importance of family bonds. </p>

			 <p>Characters: </p>

			 <p>JAY, 15 &amp; ARTY, 13, Jay's brother. The boys are well behaved for their father and get along with each other. Sort of Wally and Beaver. </p>

			 <p>EDDIE, 40s, the boys' father in desperate financial difficulties seeking Grandma's help with the boys. </p>

			 <p>BELLA, mid-30s, the boys' aunt; childlike developmentally, but not childish, sweet and excitable. </p>

			 <p>GRANDMA to the boys, 70s, angry old woman, very stern and unyielding. </p>

			 <p>LOUIE, 30-40s, the boy’s uncle, secretive, probably on the run from the mob. </p>

			 <p>GERT, late 30s, the boy’s aunt, sweet and likeable but with an unusual speech "tick", likely psychosomatic. </p>

			 <p>Please contact Catherine (cathandrus@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns. </p>
