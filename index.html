          <h3>The Real Inspector Hound</h3>

          <p>Directed by Adam Young</p>

          <p>Shows: 3/7, 3/8, 3/14 &amp; 3/15/14 with a matinee on 3/16/14</p>

          <p><strong>The Real Inspector Hound</strong> is a short, one-act play by Tom Stoppard. The plot follows two theatre critics named Moon and Birdboot who are watching a ludicrous setup of a country house murder mystery, in the style of a whodunit. By chance, they become involved in the action causing a series of events that parallel the play they are watching.</p>

          <h4>Synopsis</h4>

          <p><i>Tom Stoppard's "The Real Inspector Hound" is a play within a play. It features a badly written and badly acted British whodunnit, which is being reviewed by two prominent theater critics who hope to propel the play, and certain actresses, into stardom. However, the beauty of Stoppard's play is up to the audience: is the play being critiqued by the critics, or are the critics being critiqued by the play?</i></p>

        <h3>The Glass Menagerie</h3>
        
        <p>directed by Mike Wood.</p>

        <p>Glass Menagerie Shows: 5/9, 5/10, 5/16 &amp; 5/17/14 with a matinee on 5/18/14</p>

        Amanda Wingfield, a faded Southern belle, holds tight to her two children: Tom, an aspiring poet, and Laura, his painfully shy sister. After receiving pressure from his mother, Tom brings home a gentleman caller to meet his sister. What follows is an encounter that becomes one of the most compelling and heartbreaking stories ever told. A classic of the American stage, Tennessee Williams' deeply personal and haunting "memory play" is a touching and profound tale of love and loss, illusion and escape.
