        <strong>P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD by James Kirkwood</strong> <br>
        <strong>Directed by Rick Nantel</strong> <br>
        It's New Year's Eve in New York City. Your best friend died in September, you've been robbed twice, your
        girlfriend is leaving you, you've lost your job...and the only one left to talk to is the gay burglar you've got
        tied up in the kitchen... P.S. your cat is dead.</p>

        <strong>CHRISTMAS BELLES by Jesse Jones, &amp; Nicholas Hope &amp; James Wooten</strong> <br>
        <strong>Directed by Joe Pelonzi</strong> <br>
        It's Christmas-time in the small town of Fayro, Texas, and the infamous Futrelle Sisters Frankie, Twink and
        Honey Raye are not exactly in a festive mood. A cranky Frankie is weeks overdue with her second set of twins.
        Twink, recently jilted and bitter about it, is in jail for inadvertently burning down half the town. And
        hot-flash-suffering Honey Raye is desperately trying to keep the Tabernacle of the Lamb's Christmas Program from
        spiraling into chaos. If y'all bring the eggnog, we'll provide all the belly-laughs! Ho-ho!</p>
