            <p><span lang="EN">Sixteen years have passed since Mitch Albom promised to keep in touch with his friend/college professor, Morrie Schwartz. Morrie is an extremely lovable college professor who finds out that he is dying of ALS. Mitch learns of his diagnosis from a TV interview Ted Koppel had with Morrie. Mitch decides to make good on his promise years ago, and visit Morrie one last time to pay his respects. This leads to Mitch visiting Morrie every Tuesday, to what will become their final class together. The &ldquo;class&rdquo; is lessons in how to live. Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.</span></p>
